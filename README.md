# PWM-Signal-Generation-and-Monitoring-System
The objective of this project is to use the features given on Eclipse Software Development Kits and a STM32F0 (microprocessor) to design a system to measure the voltage across a potentiometer (POT) on the ECE 355 Emulation board and relay it to the external optocoupler for controlling the PWM signal frequency, as well as to measure the frequency of the generated PWM signal.

Course work\
This repository contains the worked solutions from the course ECE 355: Microprocessor-Based Systems, offered at the University of Victoria. The solutions, but not the templates, are my own work, and are ***not to be used in whole or in part for any purpose by anyone***. The assignment specification documents are the work of the course runners, not mine. I did not design the assignments themselves. This repository is for documentation and personal review purposes only.

DISCLAIMER:

1. If you are currently taking ECE 355, by viewing the contents of this repository you agree ***not*** to use any part of the repository code, which includes but not limits to re-defining all the variables and slight modification of the small details.
2. Using it constitues plagiarism, plagiarism and other forms of academic fraud are taken very seriously by both the University and the Department. 
3. I am not complicit in any attempt at plagiarism; by viewing this repository you immediately relinquish any claims to that effect.
